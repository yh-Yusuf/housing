Predicting USA Housing Prices With Regression.

In this project, we will develop and evaluate the performance and the
predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from houses
in Boston’s suburbs.
Once we get a good fit, we will use this model to predict the monetary value of a
house located at the Boston’s area.

A model like this would be very valuable for a real state agent who could make
use of the information provided in a dayly basis.
